1.== Introduction ==

  The OpenUDC project aims to provide a open, democratic and secure
  monetary system, compatible with universal dividend.

  This document describe the MIME-types used in to described the
  different datas which need are exchanged in OpenUDC implementations.

  Only the Content-Type field is used, which permit more flexible uses:
  It make it compatible with almost all multipart media type as defined
  in section 5.1 of [RFC2046].
  But

  OpenPGP standard [RFC4880].

2.== Conventions Used in This Document ==

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.== Validation Nodes Overview ==

  Validation Nodes, act as HTTP Servers.

  There in no restriction on the port number to reach a Validation
  Deamon, although port 11371 or 80 are recommanded.

  Validation Nodes MUST manage "GET" and "POST" word as specified by
  the protocol HTTP/1.0.

  Validation Nodes SHOULD manage "HEAD" word and "Range" parameter, as
  specified by the protocol HTTP/1.1, cf. [rfc2616].

  Validation Nodes MUST manage the MIME types defined in this document
  (cf sections ..) and send them them in the "Content-Type" parameter.

4.== Tree Structure of Validation Nodes

  As each Nodes act as an HTTP server, Node Ressources MUST be
  available trough such kind of URL :

    * http://NodeHostame[:port]/...
  or
    * https://NodeIP[:port]/...
  or
    * httpgp://NodeIP[:port]/...

  A node MUST provide determined ressources at determined
  location.

  Here is an OverView of such tree structure :

5.== Data expected in the tree structure ==

  OpenUDC application use the Content-Type "multipart/msigned",
  specified in the "HTTP OpenPGP Authentication" draft, to exchange
  signed data.

5.1= Formats used for creation sheets =

  The "udc/create" url is used to POST the creation sheet with at
  least the minimum number of required signatures. Signatures MUST by
  done by differents voters in the previous creation sheet.

  POST data MUST have the content-type multipart/msigned, as described
  in [...].

  After being validated by a node, the new creation sheet is propagated
  through other nodes. This is done in 2 steps :
	- The node signs also the creation sheet and add its signature to
      the POST data.
    - Then it propagate it using the mechanism described above. 

  There are 5 levels of fingerprints_status :
   * 0 - UNKNOWN (Reserved for eventual futur use)
   * 1 - REJECTED
   * 2 - ACCEPTED or ACTIVE (accepted in a previous creation sheet and not revoked or rejected since)
   * 3 - ALLRIGHT or ALIVE (accepted in last creation sheet)
   * 4 - VOTER or ADMIN (accepted in last creation sheet and which may vote for next one)

5.3= Propagation mechanism =

  This section describe how POST data which have to be spread
  immediately in the network are propagated to other nodes.

  This concern especially "udc/create", "udc/validate" and
  "udc/peer/register" url interfaces.

  This mechanism required that each nodes know accurately the (same)
  pool of other nodes.

  The pool synchronization is also done when using "udc/peer/register"
  url interface (so almost "recursively").

  Each node MUST declare and use the same peer list. The list is
  sorted by alphabetical order of the node's OpenPGP fingerprint.

  (It may change in the futur by considering the node's network
  topology to reduce the time of propagation - TODO. )

  Propagation is done using specific parameters in the query string.

  example:
  POST "udc/create?pdeep=2&porigin=27DF2AB5CA52B6D7A5A61974009AE2968C8F5FDA
