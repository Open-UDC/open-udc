1.== Introduction ==

  The OpenUDC project aims to provide a open, democratic and secure
  monetary system, compatible with universal dividend.

  This document describe the MIME-types used in to described the
  different datas which need are exchanged in OpenUDC implementations.

  Only the Content-Type field is used, which permit more flexible uses:
  It make it compatible with almost all multipart media type as defined
  in section 5.1 of [RFC2046].
  But

  OpenPGP standard [RFC4880].

2.== Conventions Used in This Document ==

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.== Validation Nodes Overview ==

  Validation Nodes, act as HTTP Servers.

  There in no restriction on the port number to reach a Validation
  Deamon, although port 11371 or 80 are recommanded.

  Validation Nodes MUST manage "GET" and "POST" word as specified by
  the protocol HTTP/1.0.

  Validation Nodes SHOULD manage "HEAD" word and "Range" parameter, as
  specified by the protocol HTTP/1.1, cf. [rfc2616].

  Validation Nodes MUST manage the MIME types defined in this document
  (cf sections ..) and send them them in the "Content-Type" parameter.

4.== Tree Structure of Validation Nodes

  As each Nodes act as an HTTP server, Node Ressources MUST be
  available trough such kind of URL :

    * http://NodeHostame[:port]/[Root/]...
  or
    * https://NodeIP[:port]/[Root/]...
  or
	* httpgp://NodeIP[:port]/[Root/]...

  After a eventual Root depending on the node's configuration, in its
  URL ; a node MUST provide determined ressources at determined
  location.

  Here is an OverView of such tree structure :

X.  HTTP (multi-)signed data

   HTTP (multi-)signed messages are denoted by the "multipart/msigned"
   content type, with an optional "nsigs" parameter.
   This content type is inspired by the "multipart/signed" defined in
   the [RFC3156] and dedicated for sending signed email.

   The multipart/msigned body MUST consist of at least two parts. One
   part contains the signed data in MIME canonical format, including a
   set of appropriate content headers describing the data.

   Other parts MUST contain each one a digital signature. For OpenPGP
   signatures, it MUST be labeled with a content type of
   "application/pgp-signature".

   If present, the "nsigs" parameter MUST contain a signed integer.
   The "nsigs" parameter indicated the number of detached
   signatures, as well as there position inside the "multipart/msigned"
   stream:
    - integer value indicate the number of signatures. The absolute
    value MUST be equal to the effective number of signatures in the
    stream.
    - a positive value indicate that the signatures will be placed
    after the data.
	- a negative value indicate that the signatures will be placed
    before the data. Thus permit to verify the data in one-pass as the
    digest (also know as MIC: Message Integrity Check) used to sign are
    indicated in each signature (or in their content header for others
    signature than OpenPGP).
    - The absence of the "nsigs" parameter MUST be treated as it have
    had a value of "1".

     Notes:
    - The "nsigs" parameter should not have a value of "0".
    Reading implementations may return an error in this case.
    - OpenPGP signatures may be ASCII armored or not.
     


    Example:

         Content-Type: multipart/signed; boundary=bar; nsigs=1

         --bar
        Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
        Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
     
      & 
      & =A1Hola!
      &
      & Did you know that talking to yourself is a sign of senility?
      &
      & It's generally a good idea to encode lines that begin with
      & From=20because some mail transport agents will insert a greater-
      & than (>) sign, thus invalidating the signature.
      &
      & Also, in some cases it might be desirable to encode any   =20
      & trailing whitespace that occurs on lines in order to ensure  =20
      & that the message signature is not invalidated when passing =20
      & a gateway that modifies such whitespace (like BITNET). =20
      &
      & me
      &

        --bar
        Content-Type: application/pgp-signature
