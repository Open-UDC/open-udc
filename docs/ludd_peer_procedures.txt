ludd's boot:

step 1 (peer/self status: 1, booting).
First check each peer/list of other peer in my peer/list : are they responding, it their time OK, are theire signature correct, have they the same peer list ?
(Note: also identify myself in my peer list).

Then update my peer list to the maximum of valid peers.
(If some peers answer a list with some missing or extra incorrect peers, will tell them to update their list later).

Step 2 (peer/self status: 2, initializing).

First use the peer/register to tell I am ready to receive and propagate transaction, but my status is initializing, ie : I am updating my databases, and not able to validate transaction.

The peer/register actions is propagated trough active node, and each one now check my peer/list and update their one.

Once registration is fully validated, I may start myselve a propagation mechanism.

Step 3 (peer/self status: 3, ready).

Start a propagation to tell to other peer that i am ready.
