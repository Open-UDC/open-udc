1.== Introduction ==

  The OpenUDC project aims to provide an open, democratic and secure
  monetary system, compatible with the Universal Dividend.

  This document describe the authentication mechanisms used in the
  OpenUDC implementations.

  These authentication mechanisms use and are compliant with the OpenPGP
  standard [RFC4880].

2.== Conventions Used in This Document ==

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.== Using OpenPGP certificates ==

3.1= specific uid =

  OpenUDC employs widely used OpenPGP standards for all authentications.

  An OpenUDC certificate is an OpenPGP certificate on which the comment
  field of one of its uids begins with the special string know as
  "udid3".

  As the OpenUDC characterization only uses uid in an OpenPGP certificate
  it is more accurate to speak about OpenUDC uid (inside an OpenPGP
  certificate) instead of OpenUDC certificate.

  The special string recognized by OpenUDC implementations is a sum of
  fields which MUST be separated by a semicolon ';' or an equal sign '='.

  The string MUST use only US-ASCII charset (without the semicolon which
  is reserved for separation of fields).

  The string size MUST NOT exceed 255 octets.

  First field (a.k.a. header field) indicate the meaning and the number
  of its following fields.

  OpenUDC specifies the following headers for OpenPGP uid comment field:

    - "udid1"
        Was used for Human Authentication, deprecated.
    - "udid2"
        Was used for Human Authentication, deprecated.
    - "udid3"
        Was used for Human Authentication, deprecated.
    - "udid4"
        Used for Human Authentication.
    - "ubot1"
        Was used for non-human Authentication, deprecated.
    - "nhid2"
        Used for non-human Authentication, eg: bot, organization, etc.

  The characters after the last recognized field in the string SHOULD be
  ignored and MAY use other charset (UTF-8...). They MAY be used to add
  information in a non-universal language.

3.2= Key Types =

    We recommend to use one big main key of for the OpenPGP certificate,
    and at least two subkeys in it :
    - one for encryption.
    - one for signing OpenUDC transactions and so to be use as nominative
      account.

    As smallest keys imply smallest signatures, it is recommended to
    use ECC Keys to improve performance of OpenUDC networks.

3.3= Exporting =

    Certificates MUST be exported to some well-known key servers.

    Key servers MAY be enhanced to register only OpenUDC certificates,
    and to unregister automatically OpenUDC certificates which are not
    validated periodically by some other certificate.

3.4= Expiration =

    The main key of the OpenPGP certificate should expire in less than
    11 years after its creation.

4.== Human Authentication ==

  Each human wanting to use an OpenUDC currency and to receive the
  Universal Dividend (or another basic income) MUST have a OpenPGP
  certificate in accordance with the following specifications.

4.1.= OpenUDC Unique identification string =

    An OpenUDC user MUST have, in one of its OpenPGP uid, a comment
    which begins with a special string.

    This strings look like :

    udid3;0zlnH75j_xEZzVOMeUyC1A;e+48.83+002.33;


4.1.1. Universal Digital IDentity string version 1.


    The "udid1;" header MUST be followed by 4 fields which MUST define :

    1- The last names of the individual, separated by a comma.

    2- The forenames of the individual, separated by a comma.

    3- The date of birth, as the number of seconds since
       00:00:00 UTC on Thursday, 1 January 1970.
       For people born before this date, the string will indicate a
       negative number prefixed with a character '-'.
       If the hour of birth is unknown, it SHOULD be fixed at
       12:00:00 UTC.

    4- The location of birth, defined as terrestrial coordinates.
       The first number MUST be the latitude and MUST be prefixed by
       'N' or '+' if in the Northern hemispheres, and prefixed by
       'S' or '-' if in the Southern hemispheres.
       The second number MUST be the longitude and MUST be prefixed
       by 'E' or '+' in the east from the Greenwich meridian, and
       by 'W' or '-' in the west from the Greenwich meridian.

       Latitude and longitude MUST have at least 2 digits after the
       decimal point, and at most 6 digits after the decimal point.

       Accepted range for latitude is [-90.00;+90.00].
       Accepted range for longitude is [-179.999999;+180.00].

       Second subfield is optional and may be use to define
       non-terrestrial birth.

    Note: The version 1 is deprecated and should not be used anymore.

4.1.2. Universal Digital IDentity string version 2.

    The "udid2;" header MUST be followed by a one-char field which
    define if the birth data are in clear or hashed :
    - 'c' char means the data are not hashed.
    - 'h' char means the data are hashed.

    The hashed version is obtained by applying the SHA1 algorithm on
    the clear version.

    Since we can now hash the udid, there is no more place for
    fuzziness in it, and so the rules of the clear version are
    more stringent:

    The clear version "udid2;c;" MUST be followed by 5 fields:

    1- The last last name as written on the birth certificate.
       Only the 26 upper case [A-Z] US-ASCII characters are allowed.
       That means it have to be transposed in a standardized way to
       this US-ASCII characters.

       The transposed name MUST contain at least 1 character and
       MUST not exceed 20 characters. If it reach the 20-chars
       limit, extra characters MUST be ignored.

    2- The first first name as written on the birth certificate.
       Only the 27 upper case [A-Z-] US-ASCII characters are allowed.
       That means it have to be transposed in a standardized way to
       this US-ASCII characters.

       The transposed name MUST contain at least 1 character and
       MUST not exceed 20 characters. If it reach the 20-chars
       limit, extra characters MUST be ignored.

    3- The date of birth as written on the birth certificate, but
       transposed, as specified by the ISO-8601, in the extended
       form: "YYYY-mm-dd".

    4- The location of birth. As long as individuals are born on
       Earth, it should be prefixed by a 'e' (lower case) character.
       Then following is defined as terrestrial coordinates.

       The first number MUST be the latitude and MUST be a 4 digits
       number : 2 before the decimal point and 2 after, prefixed by
       '+' if in the Northern hemispheres, and prefixed by '-' if in
       the Southern hemispheres.
       The second number MUST be the longitude and MUST be a 5 digits
       number : 3 before the decimal point and 2 after, prefixed by
       by '+' in the east from the Greenwich meridian, and by '-' in
       the west from the Greenwich meridian.

       Accepted range for latitude is [-90.00;+90.00].
       Accepted range for longitude is [-179.99;+180.00].

       For a given place of birth, only one coordinate is allowed.
       It should correspond to the coordinate of the office which
       wrote the birth certificate. And so, in general, to the
       coordinate that almost all map tools (like Google Maps)
       indicate.

    5- A number which may increase in the case of more than one
       person born with the same last name and first name at the
       same place at the same date.
       This number should therefore be equal to 0 for almost every
       one.

    The hashed version "udid2;h;" MUST be followed by 2 fields:

    1- The SHA1 of the string composed by the fields "1;2;3;4"
       of the clear version (with the three ';' delimiters).

    2- A number which may increase in the case of more than one
       child born with the same last name and first name at the
       same place at the same date, or if SHA1 collision.
       (Note: there is today less than 2^33 humans on earth...)
       Therefore this number should be equal to 0 for almost every
       one.

  Example: if a individual is registered as
         - first names: François-Xavier-Robert, Lucien
         - last name: DE CLÉREL-DE-TOCQUEVILLE
         - birth date: 14 July 1989
         - birthplace: Paris 15

   their clear udid2 will be :

   udid2;c;TOCQUEVILLE;FRANCOIS-XAVIER-ROBE;1989-07-14;e+48.84+002.30;0;

    and their hashed udid2 will be :

   udid2;h;85bbb64915ae7f2cdbe54618453b3ed107f1f242;0;

   Note1: the SHA1 can be calculated with the sha1sum tool on almost
    all recent Unix systems.

   Note2: to transpose some European characters to US-ASCII charset,
     uni2ascii tool may help.
     (http://billposer.org/Software/uni2ascii.html)

4.1.3. Universal Digital IDentity string version 3.

    As hashing also birthplace coordinates introduce fuzziness or complexity
    (need to use and maintain a signed array of coordinates). The hashed
    udid2 turned out to be dangerous and unusable.

    But obfuscating birth names and birth date was still desirable on some
    context. Then we introduced udid3 to replace udid2.

    The "udid3;" MUST be followed by a field which is the concatenation of:


    1- The 22 characters of the base64url encoded md5sum of the string composed
       by the fields "1;2;3" of the udid2 clear version (with the two ';'
       delimiters), without the last two padding characters "=".

    2- 14 characters to indicate location of birth. As long as individuals are
       born on Earth, the first character MUST be an 'e' (lower case) character.
       Then following is defined as terrestrial coordinates.

       The first number MUST be the latitude and MUST be a 4 digits
       number : 2 before the decimal point and 2 after. If value is positive
       (Northern hemisphere) it MUST be prefixed by '_' (which replace '+' for
       URL compatility). If value is negative (Southern hemisphere) it MUST be
       prefixed by '-'.

       The second number MUST be the longitude and MUST be a 5 digits
       number : 3 before the decimal point and 2 after, prefixed by '_' for
       positive values (east from the Greenwich meridian), and by '-' for
       negative values (west from the Greenwich meridian).

       Accepted range for latitude is [-90.00;+90.00].
       Accepted range for longitude is [-179.99;+180.00].

       Contrary to udid2, udid3 accept fuzziness in this coordinates.
       It even MUST use such fuzziness to distinguish people born with the same
       last name and first name at the same place at the same date, or in case
       of md5sum collision (need 2^64 random input to have a 50% chance of collision).



  Example: if a individual is registered as
         - first names: François-Xavier-Robert, Lucien
         - last name: DE CLÉREL-DE-TOCQUEVILLE
         - birth date: 14 July 1989
         - birthplace: Paris 15

   Then his clear udid2 is:

   udid2;c;TOCQUEVILLE;FRANCOIS-XAVIER-ROBE;1989-07-14;e+48.84+002.30;0;

   And his udid3 is:

   udid3;QLLqMQQFIWLBabaZU-QKfge_48.84_002.30

   Note1: using bash on almost all GNU/Linux systems, the first 22 characters
   may be calculated like this:
   echo -n "TOCQUEVILLE;FRANCOIS-XAVIER-ROBE;1989-07-14" | md5sum | xxd -r -p | basenc --base64url


4.1.4. Universal Digital IDentity string version 4.

    In the current world International Civil Aviation Organization, did also make
    a great effort to standardize human identification: the ICAO Document 9303
    (endorsed by the International Organization for Standardization and the
    International Electrotechnical Commission as ISO/IEC 7501-1) specify a
    machine-readable passport (MRP) with a standardized machine-readable zone (MRZ).

    To benefit the massive usage of this standardization, we have had to introduce
    udid4 to replace udid3 and udid2.

    Obfuscating has still many advantage: It allows conformity with the
    (flawed/sloppy) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). But also may avoid
    some discrimination based on last names or first names. Etc.

    Like the Universal Digital IDentity string version 3, "udid4=" MUST be
    followed by a field which is the concatenation of:

    1- The 22 characters of a base64url encoded md5sum, without the last two
       padding characters "=". But the data hashed there differs from the
       Universal Digital IDentity string version 3.

    2- 14 characters to indicate location of birth. Exactly like those of the
       Universal Digital IDentity string version 3, described above.


    The data which are hashed to build the first 22 characters following "udid4="
    is a concatenation of 4 fields, separated by a less-than sign '<'.

    1- The last surname at birth. Followed by an extra '<'.

    2- The first given name at birth.

    3- The second given name at birth.

    4- The date of birth.

     Inside fields 1, 2 and 3: only the 26 upper case [A-Z] US-ASCII characters are allowed.
     That means it have to be transposed in a standardized way to this US-ASCII characters.
     Field 3 (second given name) may be empty, field 1 and 2 MUST contain at least one [A-Z] character.
     Fields 1, 2 and 3 MUST not exceed 32 characters. If it reach the 32-chars limit, extra characters MUST be ignored.

     Field 4 (date of birth) MUST be formatted as specified by the ISO-8601, in the extended form: "YYYY-mm-dd".



  Example1: if a individual is registered as
         - first names: François-Xavier-Robert, Lucien
         - last name: DE CLÉREL-DE-TOCQUEVILLE
         - birth date: 14 July 1989
         - birthplace: Paris 15

   Then the name part of the MRZ of his passport may be:
   "TOCQUEVILLE<<FRANCOIS<XAVIER<ROBERT<LUC"

   The data to be hashed is:
   "TOCQUEVILLE<<FRANCOIS<XAVIER<1989-07-14"

   And his Universal Digital IDentity would be:

   udid4=vb6UZTMKsllgoH760pc0xwe_48.84_002.30


  Example2: if a individual is registered as birth as
         - given names: Federica
         - surname: ROSSINI DEL MONTE PIU LUNGO DI QUARANTA
         - birth date: O8 December 1968

   Then the name part of the MRZ of his passport may be:
   "ROSSINI<DEL<MONTE<PIU<LUNGO<DI<QUARA<<F"

   But the data to be hashed would be:
   "QUARANTA<<FEDERICA<<1968-12-08"



---

   Note1: using bash on almost all GNU/Linux systems, the first 22 characters
   may be calculated like this:
   echo -n "TOCQUEVILLE<<FRANCOIS<XAVIER<1989-07-14" | md5sum | xxd -r -p | basenc --base64url | sed 's/==$//'

   Note2: The simplest way to extract names from a MRZ is to grep "[A-Z]\{1,32\}<<[A-Z]\{1,32\}<[A-Z]\{0,32\}<"

   Notes3:

     Birth certificates or passports pose many (human) issues:
        * Fake documents
        * Issuer errors or inconsistencies
        * names changed since
        * ... etc.
     So Universal Digital IDentity string won't be sufficient or reliable to identify each individuals only once.
     The concept of Web Of Trust, defined for example by OpenPGP, is a powerful solution to complete this objective.
     But the Web Of Trust use to be also insufficient, as there often lacks of information : "trust for what ?".
     Moreover Web Of Trust grows slowly, too slowly.

     Then the faster way to reach the objective: "reliably identify everyone,
     only once", is to combine "Universal Digital IDentity", "Web Of Trust" and
     "Biometric informations" for a while.


4.2= Proof of identity =

    The identity is trusted by using the OpenPGP web of trust. This
    means that signing an OpenUDC uid is something to consider
    seriously and implies checking the ID of the individuals to sign.

    If a cheat is discovered, eg.:
     - signing a person which doesn't exist.
     - signing an udid which point to somebody else.
     - signing an udid which doesn't match the standard described in
       this document ([RFCXXXX]).
    the signatories may be held accountable and suffer consequences.

4.3= Implicit living trust level =

    For each people inside a web of trust, levels of trust may be
    calculated, depending on such parameters:
     1 - The number of signatories.
     2 - The level of trust of the signatories.
     3 - The age of the signatures.
     4 - A level indicated by signatories.
     5 - A level indicated by other humans in the web of trust.

    OpenUDC defines as "implicit living trust level" those where the
    "age of signatures" parameter may do it collapse.

    But that implies that people would not sign for dead one, which is
    not impossible. So this living trust level is not (enough) reliable.

4.4= Explicit living trust level =

    Also OpenUDC define five notations to be recognized inside a
    certificate signature:
        _alive@-=YYYY-mm-dd
        _OBJECT_vouch@-=YYYY-mm-dd
        _dead@-=YYYY-mm-dd
        _birth@-=YYYY-mm-dd
        _death@-=YYYY-mm-dd

    Where the '-' character may be replaced by a string with any
    characters except the character '@' and the character '='. This
    string may be used to indicate a place and so may contain, for
    example, a name or a coordinate.

    And where "YYYY-mm-dd" is a date, as specified by the ISO-8601, which
    indicates when the signatory have checked the identity and the life
    of the certificate's owner.

    The "_OBJECT_vouch@..." notations imply the "_alive@..." notation:
    It means that the person designated by the signed udid2 is alive
    AND that signatory vouch for him in the OBJECT context.
    "OBJECT" SHOULD so be renamed to a particular currency, or any
    other specific context which may need vouching.

    The "_birth@..." and "_death@..." notations are reserved for
    witnesses to such events.

    OpenUDC defines as "explicit living trust level" those relying on
    this 5 notations.

    If the "alive" status is not updated regularly, individual may
    supposed to be dead.

4.5= Proof of life =

    The proof of life is related with the money creation and the
    explicit living trust level: if someone in the web of trust does not
    create the share of new money which is reserved for them before a
    given date, or if its explicit living trust level become lower than
    a minimal required. They will be presumed "dead" and will be excluded
    form the calculation of the next money set.

    The share of money which "dead" people have not created however is
    counted in the monetary mass, and anyone who obtains the private key
    (eg: his heirs) may create that share, thereafter.

    If a cheat is discovered, eg. if someone or something (a robot) uses
    the private secret of somebody else or somebody dead (without being
    noticed as such), then investigation ("Cui prodest scelus is
    fecit"), prosecution, etc., may follow.

5.== Authentication of other entities ==

  Only humans may be trusted and held responsible. But humans like to
  build and use tools or organizations to improve their productivity and
  comfort.

  Today, data inflation in the fields of science and law make the tools
  or organizations more complex and interdependent. Humans may program such
  tools (eg: bots), or manage such organizations, to take important
  decisions and make important actions.

  For example, in OpenUDC networks there are bots to validate transactions.
  But bots may be programmed to do nasty things, like hiding informations
  or lying.

  To prevent that, each non-human entity is authenticated as a human's minion:

  Each non-human entity have their own OpenPGP certificate, and all its masters,
  identified by their full udid (eg: udid4=...), MUST be indicated inside the
  uids of the OpenPGP certificate.

5.1= Non-human IDentity string version 1=

  Some of the OpenPGP uid comment field MUST begin with the special string
  "ubot1;" followed immediately by the full udid of one of its master.

  e.g.: the OpenPGP certificate of François-Xavier-Robert's bot MUST
  have this string in the comment field of one of its uid:

  ubot1;udid4=vb6UZTMKsllgoH760pc0xwe_48.84_002.30;

  And this OpenPGP uid MUST be signed by the human master to prove
  they recognized this minion.

  The bot certificate SHOULD design a key of their human master as
  revocation key.

5.2= Non-human Identity string version 2=

  Each entity can be uniquely identified by a specific date and a precise
  place of birth.

  Then we define a string of 28 characters to uniquely identify any non-human
  entity:
   - 6 characters for the header : 'nhid2='
   - 8 characters for the date of birth as specified by the ISO-8601,
        in the form: "YYYYmmdd".
   - 14 characters for the location of birth. Exactly like those of the
        Universal Digital IDentity string version 3, described above.

  For example, an organization that would be officially born on April 03, 2023,
  near Gap in France; can be identified by the string :

  nhid2=20230403e_44.52_006.02

  And as only humans can be held responsible, OpenPGP certificates of non-human
  entities MUST contains responsable identities ly humans may be hold

  And since only humans can be held responsible, certificates must contain
  the identities of those responsible.

  This is done by simply concatenating the fixed-size strings "nhid2=..."
  and "udid4=..." inside OpenPGP uids of OpenPGP certificate.

  For example, if the organization identified by "nhid2=20230403e_44.52_006.02"
  is managed by François-Xavier-Robert DE CLÉREL-DE-TOCQUEVILLE, and Frederica
  ROSSINI DEL MONTE PIU LUNGO DI QUARANTA, the OpenPGP certificate MUST contain
  at least 2 uid were comment fields equal, respectively:

  nhid2=20230403e_44.52_006.02udid4=vb6UZTMKsllgoH760pc0xwe_48.84_002.30

  nhid2=20230403e_44.52_006.02udid4=H1BuGXz-aAeH1lZp2YIGVQe_41.89_012.51
