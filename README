OpenUDC is an experimental implementation of an open monetary system.
It permit :
 - To create a currency and control its monetary mass.
 - To exchange money in this currency between individuals.
 - To apply Universal monetary Dividend to the individuals that accept to use the currency.
And all of that with best efforts on security and anonymity preservation.

About Universal monetary Dividend, please read the Theory of Money Relativity from Stephane Laborde
(in french: http://www.creationmonetaire.info/2011/06/theorie-relative-de-la-monnaie-20.html) or at
least other studies about Social Credit  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit).
