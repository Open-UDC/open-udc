**[OpenUDC] (http://openudc.org)** is an open protocol for creating
and exchanging currencies.

It aims to be secure, reliable and to solve some debt, crisis or
globalization issues.  
It notably permits to apply Universal monetary Dividend to the
individuals that accept to use the currency.  
It is based upon the OpenPGP protocol ([RFC4880] (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880)).  

About Universal monetary Dividend, please read the
[Theory of Money Relativity from Stephane Laborde] (http://www.creationmonetaire.info/2011/06/theorie-relative-de-la-monnaie-20.html) (in french)
or at least other studies about [Social Credit] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit).
